-- 1- INDEX is a BTree data structure.
-- 2- Indexes are used to find values within a specific column more quickly.
-- 3- MySQL normally searches sequentially through a column, the longer the column, the more expensive the operation is gonna be.
-- 4- Sometimes we do have an index on id

-- * To show indexes
-- ! By default, employees has index on id, that's why searching for a customer using id is so much fast
-- ! but, searching for employees by their first_name or last_name is more expensive.
SHOW INDEXES from employees;

-- * Create an index for email (one-column)
CREATE INDEX email_idx
ON employees(email);

SELECT email from employees where email LIKE "%na@example.com";

-- * Drop INDEX from a table
-- ! In this example we will delete last_name_idx INDEX and create last_name_first_name_idx that do the same job of last_name_idx
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP INDEX email_idx;

-- * Create an index for last_name and first_name (many-column)
CREATE INDEX first_name_last_name_idx
ON employees(first_name, last_name);
